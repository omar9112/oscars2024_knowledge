**AMQ9637E: Channel is lacking a certificate.**

**QMGR ERROR LOG**

EXPLANATION:

The channel is lacking a certificate to use for the SSL handshake. The channel name is '<insert one>' (if '????' it is unknown at this stage in the SSL processing).The remote host is '<insert three>'. The channel did not start.

ACTION:

Make sure the appropriate certificates are correctly configured in the key repositories for both ends of the channel.

**SOLUTION**

Potential Causes:

1\. File ermission issue on the keystore or truststore files.

2\. Missing keystore truststore or keystore or truststore not found.

3\. Missing personal certificate in the keystore.

4\. Incorrect label name.

5\. Incorrect signature algorithm.

6\. Incomplete cert chain if using a CA signed certificate.

Solution 1:

Verify the file permissions on the keystore files, ensure that the user running the IBM MQ processes or application has read access to these files. On Unix variations, usually ensuring the mqm group has read access is adequate.

Solution2:

Confirm these properties are set correctly.

A queue manager and non-Java clients use the SSLKEYR property to locate its keystore.

Ensure that the SSLKEYR is the stem of the keystore location.

IE: If the keystore is located at /var/mqm/qmgrs/EXAMPLEQM/ssl/key.kdb

The stem is: /var/mqm/qmgrs/EXAMPLEQM/ssl/key

Java clients can use JVM system properties

-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=

-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=

Solution 3:

Confirm the personal certificate exists.

To list personal certificates:

runmqckm -cert -list personal -db (keystore filename)

versus the following, which lists signer certificates:

runmqckm -cert -list CA -db (keystore filename)

Solution 4:

The default certificate label name for a IBM MQ client is ibmwebspheremq followed by the userid, all in lowercase.

Solution 5:

Needs to be an RSA signature algorithm.

Solution 6:

Validate the certificate chain based on this article: [IBM MQ Certificate Authority Chain Information](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-mq-certificate-authority-chain-information)
